    <p>There’s no more joyful way to spend an afternoon than baking. I do most of the cooking in our house, but baking recipes are the ones that bring Jack and me together. He might stretch a batch of pizza dough while I prep the toppings, or we’ll work together to make a jumbo tray of cinnamon rolls to devour the next morning. If you have kids, easy baking recipes are a great way to get them into the kitchen. Let them stir together brownies and lick the spoon or decorate a batch of cookies with bright sprinkles and frosting. The process might be messy, but the results will be delicious nonetheless.</p>

<p>I hope these <strong>baking recipes</strong>  inspire you to set yourself a new cooking challenge, just for the fun of it, or to spend a few hours in the kitchen with someone you care about. With cookies, quick breads, bao buns, and more, you’re sure to find a recipe you’ll love.</p>
